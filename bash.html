			<b>Shell (bash) scripting, its benefits and dangers (and how to protect from them)</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Shell is a program that users employ to run commands for the operating system to execute. These can be very simple 
			instructions such as coping or moving files, or long scripts that contain hundreds of commands. Users typically 
			interact with a shell using a terminal window (also referred to as command line), which can be run from the same or 
			a remote machine. There are different types of shells, but I will refer in this tutorial only to the Bourne-Again shell, 
			which is the most commonly used. The Bourne-Again shell (or simply shell, as most people call it) is installed by 
			default in any Linux or MacOS. The programming language used to write commands and scripts in shell is called bash.
			</p>

			<p>
			The terminal window for Mac can be found inside the applications folder and in the subfolder Utilities. You can also 
			open it by pressing the command and space bar in your keyboard to open the spotlight and then type Terminal. 
			In Linux, the easiest way to open the terminal is to use the key combination Ctl + Alt + T.
			</p>

			<p>
			Shell scripting is very powerful; it allows you to run any instruction on your computer or a remote machine. Things 
			that normally would take hours to do could be executed in seconds. For example, if you have thousands of files 
			inside a folder, which need to be renamed following a pattern, it would take forever to rename those files by hand. 
			However, using the command line you could do it in seconds. When you write a shell script, you know exactly what and 
			how you did things, and you will be able to replicate those commands on different files, datasets or programs.
			</p>

			<p>			
			However, as powerful as scripting is, it is also very dangerous. Through the terminal you will have access to any 
			files or system resources if you have the right permissions, and the freedom to do anything with them. Inadvertent 
			"small" typing errors such as adding an extra space in the remove command (<font class="bashcommand">rm</font>) could delete everything in your 
			computer (including the root directory) or any external drive connected to your machine. Similarly, the contents of 
			any file could be mistakenly removed in less than a second. What makes it harder to prevent these errors is that 
			many commands differ in name by only one letter.
			</p>

			<p>
			Unfortunately, there is no way to completely protect your computer from potential mistakes that you may (and you 
			will at some point) do when writing and running shell scripts. However, there are a couple of tips that you can 
			follow in order to minimize the chances of making irreparable mistakes or to prevent any mistake from becoming a 
			catastrophe:
			</p>	

			<ol>
				<li>
				First and most importantly, create constant backups of either your entire drive or the most important folders. 
				Preferably save those backups in an external hard drive or remote machine, which won't be constantly connected 
				to your computer. It is not a bad idea to have more than one backup if your data is not easily recoverable.
				</li><br>

				<li>
				If you're using a shared computer or account, control access permissions to important files and folders. You can 
				control for each file and folder who and what can be done. By managing permissions, you can allow a file to be 
				read but not to be written (hence preventing it from being modified or deleted). Or you can authorize only a 
				user or group of users for viewing, reading, writing or executing a file. In chapter 12 you will learn how to 
				manage permissions.
				</li><br>

				<li>
				The root user is an account in any Linux or Unix operating system (i.e. MacOS) that has access to absolutely all 
				commands, files and directories. When you login as a root in the command line, you can modify, read and write 
				protected folders and files. This is very helpful when installing software or modifying the default settings of 
				your computer. However, coding as the root user can be extremely dangerous. It is very normal to make mistakes 
				when coding and if you have all permissions, you could mistakenly delete, move or modify files that should not 
				be touched. For this reason, it is advisable to only login as a root when strictly necessary and log out once 
				you're done. More information about the root user will be covered in chapter 12.
				</li><br>

				<li>
				Use aliases to protect from "dangerous" commands. Two of the most commonly used but dangerous commands are 
				<font class="bashcommand">rm</font> (to remove files) and <font class="bashcommand">mv</font> (to move files). 
				The <font class="bashcommand">mv</font> command can be as harmful as the <font class="bashcommand">rm</font> 
				command because if you specify the wrong target or source paths, you can end up deleting a big number of files. 
				When you use any of these two commands, always double check what you have written before clicking enter.
				</li><br>

				<li>
				Be careful when copy pasting commands from a website into the terminal. There can be errors that will be 
				executed right away if the text you're copying contains a carriage return at the end of the line. It is better 
				to paste into a shell script and then either execute the shell script or copy from the shell script into the 
				command line. Although generally not dangerous, you might also run into errors when copy pasting from Microsoft 
				word or other editors that modify symbols such as dash or underscore and convert them into new symbols that 
				bash won't understand.
				</li>

			<h4><a href="#content2.1" onclick="showContent(2.1)">2.1. The vi editor</a></h4>
			<div id="content2.1" class="hidden">
				<p>
				There are an unlimited number of editors available for writing shell scripts in Linux and Mac. A few are 
				installed by default; some are used through the terminal and some others use a graphical interface (GUI). 
				They all have pros and cons and the decision to use one or another is totally personal. In this section I will 
				explain how to use the editor vi, which is installed by default in both Linux and MacOS and can be accessed and 
				used through the terminal window. 
				</p>
				
				These are some of the advantages of vi:
				<ul>
					<li>
					It is available in all Unix systems and any type of terminal.
					</li>
					
					<li>
					It doesn't require a lot of memory to run. So, if you are running many heavy programs in your computer, 
					vi is a good option because it won't slow down the machine anymore and will still load very fast.
					</li>
					
					<li>
					Even though there are a lot of commands that you must learn to become skilled in using this program, once 
					you learn them you can use very short and fast commands to accomplish a lot of things. For example, you 
					can delete all the characters from your current cursor location to the end of the line, just by pressing two 
					times the d in your keyboard (while in command mode). Below you will find a chart with the most commonly used 
					shortcuts in vi.
					</li>
					
					<li>
					You can use it to code in different languages (i.e. it also works for Python, HTML, etc.).
					</li>
					
					<li>
					Some editors add special characters to the text and when you run scripts written in those editors, they could
					fail. vi doesn't add any special characters, and if it did, they are visible in the editor.
					</li>
					
					<li>
					If you don't like using your mouse too much, or you don't have a mouse, or your mouse doesn't work 
					properly, then vi editor is a good choice because you rarely need to use the mouse. Most things are 
					accomplished using the keyboard.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				However, there are some disadvantages too:
				<ul>
					<li>
					The learning curve can be steep, especially for people who are new to programming and not very comfortable 
					with computers. If you're new to bash, you not only need to learn the language, but also a whole set of 
					commands specific to this program. 
					</li>
					
					<li>
					Not being able to use your mouse can end up wasting your time while you learn all the commands that are used 
					to scroll around the file or jump from one line to another.
					</li>
					
					<li>
					It doesn't give you any error messages or explanation of why it's not doing what you want. If you type the 
					wrong command, it will just do nothing (or do the wrong thing).
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
				Generally, many people with relatively good experience programming love this editor. In my opinion, it's a good 
				tool to use once you are familiar with shell and have been programming for a while. However, it might be a great 
				option for you if you like challenges or if you are already somehow familiar with shell.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To create a new file, type (on the command line) 
				<font class="bashcommand">vi &lt;filePath&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</font>. For example, if you want to create a file 
				called test.sh in the desktop, you should type <font class="bashcommand">vi ~/Desktop/test.sh</font>. The vi 
				editor will open in the current terminal.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				This program runs in two modes, the command mode and the typing mode. By default, it opens in command mode. 
				What this means is that anything you type is not actually being registered in the file but are commands. For 
				example, if you type <font class="bashcommand">:q!</font> as soon as you open the file, it will quit without 
				saving (because <font class="bashcommand">:q!</font> is the command for ignoring any modifications and exiting. 
				If you type <font class="bashcommand">:w</font> it will save changes to the file (or if you haven't write 
				anything, it will just create an empty file). To change to typing mode, type <font class="bashcommand">a</font> 
				(<font class="bashcommand">a</font> is the command for entering typing mode). After you type a (in lower case), 
				you can start editing your file. To go back to command mode (for example to save changes), press the key 
				<font class="bashcommand">esc</font> (top left corner of the keyboard).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<u>Example</u>: Open the vi editor, create a script that prints "Hello Word", and save it with the file name 
				helloword.sh
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Step 1: Open the vi editor<br><br>
				<img src="vi_1.png"/>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Step 2: Type <font class="bashcommand">a</font> to start editing the file. You will see that an 
				<b>--Insert--</b> message in the bottom of the terminal appears. This means that now you are in typing mode.<br><br>
				<img src="vi_2.png"/>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Step 3: Start typing commands. The simplest command, to print a message such as 
				<font class="bashcommand">"Hello World"</font> (or any other) is <font class="bashcommand">echo</font>. The 
				syntax of this command is the word <font class="bashcommand">echo</font> followed by the message you want to 
				print out between quotation marks (in this case <font class="bashcommand">"Hello World!"</font>).<br><br>
				<img src="vi_3.png"/>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Step 4: Once you finish your script, press the <font class="bashcommand">esc</font> key to enter command mode. 
				You will see that the <b>--Insert--</b> message at the bottom of the terminal disappears (this means that now 
				you are in command mode).<br><br>
				<img src="vi_4.png"/>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Step 5: Save changes and exit the vi editor. In order to do this, type <font class="bashcommand">:wq</font> 
				(to write (<font class="bashcommand">w</font>) and quit (<font class="bashcommand">q</font>) at the same time). 
				The table below will show you the most commonly used commands for vi.<br><br>
				<img src="vi_5.png"/>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Step 6: To be able to execute the script, you will have to give it running permissions. The topic of 
				permissions is a lot more complicated, so I will not go into details now (I will talk about it later). For now, 
				all you need to know is that to give running permissions to your script you have to type 
				<font class="bashcommand">chmod 775 helloword.sh</font><br><br>
				<img src="vi_6.png"/>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The following table shows a list of vi commands that can be used in command mode and the action that will 
				happen in each case. In general, a number preceding any vi command will tell vi to repeat the command that 
				number of times. For example, <font class="bashcommand">p</font> is the command for pasting. If you write 
				(in command mode) <font class="bashcommand">2p</font>, then vi will paste whatever you copied two times where 
				the cursor is currently located.

				As I previously mentioned, there is an unlimited number of editors and the choice of which to use is totally 
				personal. The following editors are available for both Linux and MacOS: vim, emacs, gedit (which is also 
				installed by default in Linux and uses a GUI, great for beginners), and Eclipse (among many others). Eclipse 
				is a lot more than an editor; it is a development environment used for programming in many other languages 
				(mainly Java) and for software development and modeling. The following are editors available only for MacOS: 
				Xcode, TextWrangler, TextMate, Notepad++, and Atom (among many others).

			<h4><a href="#content2.3" onclick="showContent(2.3)">2.3. Tips for writing scripts</a></h4>
			<div id="content2.3" class="hidden">
				<ol>
					<li>
					Albeit not mandatory, the first line of any bash script should be the shebang 
					(<font class="bashcommand">#!/bin/bash</font>). This line indicates that the script is written in bash 
					(instead of tcsh, for example) and that the bash interpreter should execute it.<br><br>
					</li>
					
					<li>
					Be organized when writing scripts. As you start writing longer and more complicated programs, this 
					will become more important. Try to comment as often as possible so that other people can understand what 
					your script is doing, which parameters are needed and what they mean or to understand the output. 
					Commenting will also help you fix errors or keep track of the version, changes, authorship, etc, or to 
					remember what your script does if you don't use it for a while. To insert a comment, you simply start the 
					line with a hash (<font class="bashcommand">#</font>). Any line that starts with this symbol will not be 
					executed (except for the shebang). Also try to use indentation to know where pieces of code start and end 
					(for example when doing loops). If you don't indentate, understanding your own code will be very 
					difficult. Part of being organized is also using appropriate variable names. Use names that are associated 
					to the structure you're using (for example, if you're creating an array, naming it 
					<font class="bashcommand">array</font> will help you remember that this variable is an array and not a 
					string or a number) and try to use short names (for example, instead of naming a variable 
					<font class="bashcommand">myListOfSubjects</font>, you can call it 
					<font class="bashcommand">subjList</font>).</br><br>
					</li>
					
					<li>
					It is also a good idea to use the following commands at the beginning of any script:</br>
					<font class="bashcommand">set -e</font>: This will make the program exit as soon as it encounters an error. 
					If you don't use this, then even if there's an error your code will continue to execute.<br> 
					<font class="bashcommand">set -u</font>: This will make the program exit when using undeclared variables. 
					It will prevent the program from executing the wrong commands if you misspell a variable name.<br><br>
					</li>
					
					<li>
					Use double quotes (<font class="bashcommand">"</font>) when declaring a string, single quotes 
					(<font class="bashcommand">'</font>) when declaring a character, and no quotes when declaring numbers. 
					This will prevent word splitting (when declaring a string that has spaces) and other errors in your 
					code.<br><br>
					</li>
					
					<li>
					Use functions. This topic will be covered in chapter X. Using functions will make your code more readable, 
					reusable, and will allow you to run only parts of the code without having to comment all the lines. This 
					is especially useful when debugging or re-running a script.<br><br>
					</li>
					
					<li>
					If you are declaring a variable that the value should never change, then use the word 
					<font class="bashcommand">readonly</font> before the variable name.<br> 
					For example, if I want to declare a variable called <font class="bashcommand">age</font> with value 
					<font class="bashcommand">30</font> and this value should never be replaced, then you should declare it 
					like this:<br>
					<font class="bashcommand">readonly age=30</font><br>
					Instead of:<br>
					<font class="bashcommand">age=30</font><br><br>
					
					If at some point in the script you try to replace the value of that variable, you will get an error message:
					<br>
					<font class="bashcommand">readonly age=30</font><br>
					<font class="bashcommand">age=29</font><br>
					<font class="bashcommand">-bash: age: readonly variable</font>

				<p>
				A very important aspect of programming (in bash or any other language) is the ability to use a label (called 
				variable) to indicate some other quantity (a number, character, string or command). For example, I can use 
				the variable <font class="bashcommand">${desktop}</font> to represent the string 
				<font class="bashcommand">"/Users/monica/Desktop"</font>. Or the variable 
				<font class="bashcommand">${year}</font> to represent the number <font class="bashcommand">2020</font> 
				(after correctly declaring these variables). Variables can be used for many purposes, including making the 
				code more readable, short and organized and to prevent typing errors. They are also very useful in cases in 
				which the actual value of a variable is not known before executing the program, or when you need to save the 
				output of one command to use as input for another command. For example, when reading the contents of a file 
				you can read line by line in an iterative manner (which you will learn later), saving each line in a variable 
				and then doing something with it (depending the purpose of the program). 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The easy thing about declaring variables in bash is that you don't have to specify data types. However, if 
				the value that you are assigning is a string of characters, you should use quotation marks 
				(<font class="bashcommand">"</font>) between the beginning and the end of your string (especially if the 
				string contains spaces). You must also be careful to not include any white space between the variable name, 
				the equals sign, and the value. Additionally, be aware that the quotation marks used in bash are 
				<font class="bashcommand">"</font>, which is different than those used in Microsoft Word. They look very 
				similar, but bash won't recognize the later ones. So, if you copy-paste from Microsoft Word a command that
				includes quotation marks, you will probably get an error.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<font class="example">Declaring variables of different data types</font><br>
				In the following commands, I will assign a number to the variable <font class="bashcommand">YEAR</font>, a String 
				to the variables <font class="bashcommand">MONTH</font> and <font class="bashcommand">NAME</font> and a character to 
				the variable <font class="bashcommand">GENDER</font>. As you can observe, numbers, strings and characters should 
				be declared in a different manner.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<font class="bashcommand">
				$ YEAR=2018<br>
				$ MONTH="August"<br>
				$ NAME="Monica Keith"<br>
				$ GENDER='F'
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<font class="example">Common mistakes when declaring variables</font><br>
				The following commands will produce errors because there is a white space before and/or after the equal sign 
				(<font class="bashcommand">=</font>), or because the quotation marks (<font class="bashcommand">"</font>) are 
				missing when declaring a string that contains a space. Bellow each erroneous command you can see the error 
				that Bash produces.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<font class="bashcommand">
				$ NAME ="Monica Keith"<br>
				-bash: NAME: command not found<br>
				$ NAME= "Monica Keith"<br>
				-bash: Monica Keith: command not found<br>
				$ NAME = "Monica Keith"<br>
				-bash: NAME: command not found<br>
				$ NAME=Monica Keith<br>
				-bash: Keith: command not found
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Once you assign a value to a variable, you can reference it with a dollar sign, located immediately before 
				the variable name. You can also reference a variable by including curly brackets 
				(<font class="bashcommand">{}</font>) at the beginning and the end of the variable name. It is better (but 
				not mandatory) to always reference variables using brackets. This will prevent errors in your code (specially 
				when referencing strings that have spaces or special characters).
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<font class="example">Referencing variables</font><br>
				In the following example, I will declare variable <font class="bashcommand">VAR1</font> with value 
				<font class="bashcommand">2</font>, and variable <font class="bashcommand">VAR2</font> with value 
				<font class="bashcommand">"Subject"</font>. Then, I will use the function 
				<font class="bashcommand">echo</font> to print in the command line the value of the two variables.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<font class="bashcommand">
				$ VAR1=2<br>
				$ VAR2="Subject"<br>
				$ echo ${VAR1}<br>
				2<br>
				$ echo ${VAR2}<br>
				Subject
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<font class="example">Common mistakes when referencing variables</font><br>
				When referencing a variable, be careful not to include any space before or after the brackets. The following 
				examples will produce an error because of the inclusion of a space around the brackets:
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<font class="bashcommand">
				$ echo ${ VAR2}<br>
				-bash: ${ VAR2}: bad substitution<br>
				$ echo ${VAR2 }<br>
				-bash: ${VAR2 }: bad substitution<br>
				$ echo ${ VAR2 }<br>
				-bash: ${ VAR2 }: bad substitution
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The following erroneous reference (with a space between the dollar sign and the first bracket) will not cause 
				an error but will not substitute <font class="bashcommand">${VAR2}</font> for the correct value. It will just 
				print <font class="bashcommand">$ {VAR2}</font> instead of <font class="bashcommand">Subject</font>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<font class="bashcommand">
				$ echo $ {VAR2}<br>
				$ {VAR2}
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<font class="example">Concatenating variables</font><br>
				You can concatenate different variables and characters to form new strings. To do this, you will need to 
				reference the variables using the curly brackets and use quotation marks at the beginning and the end of your 
				final string. For example, if you want to use the previously declared variables 
				<font class="bashcommand">VAR1</font> and <font class="bashcommand">VAR2</font> to generate the String 
				<font class="bashcommand">Subject_02</font>, you can concatenate them the following way:
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<font class="bashcommand">
				$ echo ${VAR2}<br>
				Subject<br>
				$ echo ${VAR1}<br>
				2<br>
				$ echo "${VAR2}_0${VAR1}"<br>
				Subject_02
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Here are a few more examples on how to declare and concatenate variables:
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<font class="bashcommand">
				$ ID="Subject_202"<br>
				$ VOLUME=20<br>
				$ MEASURE="mm"<br>
				$ echo "${ID}: ${VOLUME}${MEASURE}"<br>
				Subject_202: 20mm
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<font class="bashcommand">
				$ VAR1="MacOS"<br>
				$ VAR2="Linux"<br>
				$ VAR3="Windows"<br>
				$ echo "(${VAR1},${VAR2},${VAR3})"<br>
				(MacOS,Linux,Windows)
				</font>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<font class="example">A common mistake when concatenating variables</font><br>
				It is very common when you are referencing many variables or concatenating variables to create a long string 
				to forget the closing quotation mark. For example, writing<br>
				<font class="bashcommand">echo "(${VAR1},${VAR2},${VAR3})</font><br>
				instead of<br>
				<font class="bashcommand">echo "(${VAR1},${VAR2},${VAR3})"</font>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				When that happens and you click enter in the keyboard, the command line won't allow you to enter any more 
				commands. You will see the symbol <font class="bashcommand">></font> and if you continue pressing enter it 
				will do nothing. This is because the command line is waiting for you to close the open String. To close the 
				string just add the missing quotation mark or cancel and ignore what you have written so far in the current 
				line by pressing CTR+C.

			<h4><a href="#content3.2" onclick="showContent(3.2)">3.2. Rules for assigning variable names</a></h4>
			<div id="content3.2" class="hidden">
				<p>You can assign any value to a variable. However, a variable cannot have just any name. There are a few 
				rules for assigning variable names.</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>
					A variable name should not be a number.<br>
					This type of variable is only used to read arguments on a shell script. For example, 
					<font class="bashcommand">$1</font> refers to the first argument of a script, 
					<font class="bashcommand">$2</font> to the second argument, etc. Later you will learn the meaning and use 
					of script arguments.
					</li><br>
					
					<li>
					Variable names must start with an alphabetical letter or an underscore.<br>
					Variable names can contain any number, but it should not be located at the beginning.
					</li><br>
					
					<li>
					Do not use <font class="bashcommand">$</font> or <font class="bashcommand">${}</font> to declare a 
					variable. These characters are used only to reference variables (not to declare).
					</li><br>
					
					<li>
					Do <u>NOT</u> assign the name <font class="bashcommand">PATH</font> to any variable.<br>
					If you do so, you won't get any error right away. But it will mess up the execution of other programs. 
					<font class="bashcommand">PATH</font> is a system variable that specifies a set of directories where 
					executable programs are located. For example, when you install a software that runs in the command line 
					(i.e. FSL), the path to the executable of that program will be included in the system variable 
					<font class="bashcommand">PATH</font>. So, if you rename that variable, you won't be able to execute the 
					program again in the current terminal. If you forget about this rule and mistakenly re-write the value 
					of this variable, close the current terminal and open a new one. Every time you open a new terminal, 
					this system variable will be re-set to the correct value (which is stored in the bash_profile, we will 
					talk about this file in a later chapter). At any moment you can know the value of your 
					<font class="bashcommand">PATH</font> by typing <font class="bashcommand">echo ${PATH}</font>. You will 
					see something like this (although this will significantly varies between one computer and the other 
					depending which programs you have installed and referenced in the bash_profile):<br><br>
					
					<font class="bashcommand">
					$ echo ${PATH}<br>
					/usr/local/fsl/bin:/Applications/freesurfer/bin:/Applications/freesurfer/fsfast/bin:/Applications/freesurfer/tktools:/usr/local/fsl/bin:/Applications/freesurfer/mni/bin:/Users/bunbury/bin:/Applications/MATLAB_R2018a.app/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin
					</font><br><br>
					
					Another Unix reserved name that you should not use is <font class="bashcommand">BASH</font>. There is a long list 
					of Unix reserved words that I will not include here but you will learn as you get more experienced.
					</li><br>
					
					<li>
					Avoid using the following reserved characters from appearing in variable names:
					<font class="bashcommand">/ &gt; &lt; | : &amp; . *</font>
					</li>
				</ol>
